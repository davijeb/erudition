Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of 
features given the value of the class variable. Bayes’ theorem states the following relationship, given class variable  x0 and dependent feature vector x1  through , :
